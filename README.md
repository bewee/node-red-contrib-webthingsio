When you drag in one of the nodes of this addon, you are requested to create a new gateway. For this, you need to enter an access token. In order to obtain it, go to `Settings > Developer > Create local authorization` on your gateway. Make sure that all devices are checked and that "monitor and control" is selected. Then click allow and copy the token from the first text field.
